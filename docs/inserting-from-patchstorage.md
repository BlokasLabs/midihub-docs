# Inserting from Patchstorage

User uploaded pipelines can be browsed for and imported using the Patchstorage pane. You may toggle its visibility
using View->Patchstorage menu option, or pressing F5 on the keyboard.

You may filter results using the search bar and you may specify how you'd like the list sorted.

To import a patch from Patchstorage, double click on the list entry of interest, or use the 'Enter' / 'Return' key on keyboard to open the
[Insert Preview](insert-preview.md). The preview will show how the pipelines will look like, as well as the full description of the patch as
available on Patchstorage. The pipes can be modified before importing, you may want to do so to set up the input and output ports according to
your hardware setup.
