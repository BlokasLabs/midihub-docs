Patch at the bottom of the current preset. You may also Drag and Drop the preset from the list straight into the current preset to insert it
in the dropped location. These actions will open the [Insert Preview](insert-preview.md). The preview will show how the pipelines will look like,
as well as the full description of the patch as available on Patchstorage. The pipes can be modified before importing, you may want to do so to set
