# Sustain

![sustain](https://blokas.io/images/midihub/pipes/sustain.svg)

A modifier pipe that drops Note Off messages, according to its Mode and Pedal On parameters. Produces all the necessary note off messages once the Pedal is off.
Chord mode can be used to automatically turn off previous notes once a new chord is being played. Sostenuto holds only the notes that were playing at the time the Pedal was pushed, allowing the performer to play further notes as noraml.
