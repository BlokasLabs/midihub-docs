# Inserting Pipelines from File

Pipelines from files may be imported into the current Preset in 2 ways: 

1. by using **File->Append from File...** - always inserts the contents at the bottom of the active preset.
2. using right click menu's **Insert from File...** option to insert into a particular row in the preset.

After picking the .mhp file to import, a [preview dialog](insert-preview.md) will be displayed to show the pipelines that are about to be inserted
as well as allow to make edits before they get imported.
