# Insert Preview

The Preview window shows what is about to get imported. At this stage, you may want to:

* **Change all input or output ports** as needed for your setup. (Can be changed in bulk via the right click menu)

* **Edit pipe parameters** and/or **delete** unnecessary pipes.

* **Remap MIDI mapped parameters**, or **clear them out** using Edit->Clear All Mappings.

* **Merge Names...** (in case the names differ when accepting the dialog, the Merge Names dialog will be shown in order to reconcile the names into the main preset)

Radio button is available for selecting whether to show the port names of the incoming preset or the main preset.

Virtual input or output pipes that use the same port letter in the main preset are indicated by a purple rectangle in their corners. This gives you a chance to adjust their source/destination properties as necessary prior to inserting into the main preset.
