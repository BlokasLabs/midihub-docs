# Insert Preview

The Preview window shows what is about to get imported. At this stage, you may want to:

* **Change all input or output ports** as needed for your setup. (Can be changed in bulk via the right click menu)

* **Edit pipe parameters** and/or **delete** unnecessary pipes.

* **Remap MIDI mapped parameters**, or **clear them out** using Edit->Clear All Mappings.
